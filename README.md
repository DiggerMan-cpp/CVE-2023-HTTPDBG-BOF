# HTTPDBG-Activator-
In short, this is a keygen, the advantage of https://www.blast.hk/threads/79266/ is that it activates the license in short, and does not just remove the window asking you to enter a license, because in the kinchstat method, a yellow block remains. asking for license activation, there is no such thing here.
Just open the keygen and wait, all the magic will happen by itself.
There is also my favorite animation during generation, almost the same as when installing packages in Arch Linux, p.s. pacman
p.s not 0 day
For those interested:â€‹
```c
 v3 = _rand() % 255;
  v2 = _rand() % 255;
  v4 = _rand();
  sprintf_s(
    Buffer,
    0x11u,
    "%02X%02X%02X7C%02X%02X%02X%02X",
    v2 ^ 0x7C,
    (unsigned __int8)~(_BYTE)v3,
    v4 % 255;
    (unsigned __int8)(v4 % 255) ^ 7,
    v3 ^ (unsigned __int8)~(v4 % 255));
```
